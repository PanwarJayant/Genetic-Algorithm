# Genetic-Algorithm
ML Project that aims to utilize Genetic Algorithm for generalizing an overfit model with only its features' coefficients known.

# Contents
- **Generations**: contains all the generations of the coefficients that have evolved using the genetic algorithm
- **Report.pdf**: detailed report of the project
- **main.py**: contains the code for the project
- **output.json**: best set of vectors obtained after generalizing the overfit model
